Reference document for the installation of Hadoop and its 
supporting frameworks inside the EC2 instances. 

The below commands have worked on EC2 OpenSuse Amazon AMI
The instance has been connected with the EBS that is persistent. So for the 
tenure of anothe 10 days, this setup will continue. The instance has been tested 
for the reboot and poweroff persistence before beginning the following process.

I had initially forgotten about the challenges the different linux flavors can pose.
Amazon provides a CentOS/ RHEL based Linux in its AMIs. Which is not as easy 
as I thought. I am relooking at using ubuntu/ debian based AMI.

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

sudo yum install openssh-server openssh-clients
 
sudo yum install -y python3 python3-pip 

python3 -m venv python3-virtualenv

sudo yum install -y telnet groff postgresql-client vim

sudo rm -rf /var/cache/yum

The above steps are required of CentOS/RHEL based flavors. Aborting the steps...

After the Ubuntu 22.04LTS was instantiated, following challenges faced.

1) There was no need to install the amazon-ssm-manager, which means no user data.
However for the SSH to work, the iam role still needs to be assigned.
2) The passwd change command used in the script, by using chpasswd is not working when doing manually,
so I changed the passwd for the emrminion user manually, and it worked(I think)
3) The basic environment setting etc has been completed. 
Now starting the real installation.
